# Soulbound

A simple server-side implementation of the classic Soulbound enchantment.
To make it server-side, it's not technically an enchantment.
You can't get it via enchanting table, similar to mending.

## Incompatibilites

An incompatibility with ConfiguredKeepInventory is expected, though untested. A PR to CKI to fix compatibility is planned.
